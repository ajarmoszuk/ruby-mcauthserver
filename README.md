Kitler - A Minecraft Authentication Server
=================

Minecraft Authentication Server in Ruby

Please note that this server only supports 1.6.4 and has been open sourced as it's currently deprecated as it was too heavy on the CPU and replaced with a Java alternative. You are welcome to commit any changes to the code but I will not maintain it.

You will need RVM to install Ruby 2.0.0-p195.

To use it you will need these gems for Ruby:

eventmachine actionmailer actionpack activemodel activerecord activesupport addressable arel atomic bcrypt-ruby bindata builder bindata bundler bundler-unload coffee-rails coffee-script coffee-script-source commonjs cookiejar em-http-request em-socksify erubis eventmachine execjs hike http_parser i18n jbuilder jquery-rails json less less-rails libv8 mail mime-types minitest multi_json polyglot puma rack rack-test rails railties rake rdoc ref rubygems-bundler rvm sass sass-rails sdoc sprockets sprockets-rails sqlite3 therubyracer thor thread_safe tilt treetop turbolinks tzinfo uglifier bindata em-http-request


Yeah, have fun!
